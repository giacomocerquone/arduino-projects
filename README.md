These are projects that I've developed with Arduino

## - Arduino-Pong-TVout

#### Description

This short code is actually very simple and allows you to play the famous game Pong on your Arduino linked to the TV using a RCA cable.

#### What You Need

To compile this game and download it in your board you must have:
* Arduino, obviously (refer to TVout library to know which version is supported).
* A RCA female video connector.
* Two buttons to connect to Arduino to move the pong stick.
* The [TVout library](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tvout/) for Arduino.

## - Jingle Bells with Arduino
######[Blog Post](http://blog.giacomocerquone.com/jingle-bell-with-an-arduino-and-a-buzzer/)<br/>
I wanted to replace our broken little Santa Claus shaped box that used to play Jingle Bells through a Buzzer with Arduino! This is the result:

#### What I used
1. Arduino Uno
2. Buzzer
3. 220Ω resistor
4. Case, wires and a little breadbord

#### Wiring

#### Ideas to let others improve it
1. Using a potentiometer to adjust the volume (I had only a 50K potentiometer and it's too much for the buzzer)
2. Using buttons to switch between a vierity of songs
